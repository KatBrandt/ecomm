#Ecomm App

## Purpose
This is a fun, side-project I took on to play with Hotwire, Tailwind CSS, and Devise. I'll reflect on my learning as I'm done with this project.

## Specs
- Rails 7.1.2
- Ruby 3.2.2
- Running rails with RSpec and SQLite

## To run locally in development:
- clone repo
- bundle install
- `bin/dev` to start server (do this as opposed to `rails s` to ensure you get all the Tailwind css updates)
- to access admin dashboard, use username: admin@example.com, password: password
